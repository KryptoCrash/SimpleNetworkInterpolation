# Simple Network Interpolation
Simple multiplayer interpolation example in javascript using bezier interpolation, socket.io and phaser.

You've probably heard about interpolations in multiplayer games, but how do you do it?
This example shows how a simple bezier interpolation can make movement much smoother.
All I do in this example is use the velocity of the mouse and it's position to calculate a nice curve that represents a better path of your mouse.

Includes visual debugging lines, client/server networking.
